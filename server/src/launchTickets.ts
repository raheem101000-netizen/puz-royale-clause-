 * One-time tickets that let PuzGameLobby — and only PuzGameLobby — start a
 * puz_room. Room types registered with defineRoom can also be created by any
 * client through matchmaking (POST /matchmake/create/puz_room), and the
 * options there are client-controlled, so without this a logged-in player
 * could open a match room with a roster of their choosing and collect a
 * win credit without going through a lobby. A ticket is 128 random bits held
 * only in this server's memory and consumed on first use, so a client can't
 * forge or replay one.
